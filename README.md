# Library Management System - React Frontend

This is the frontend for the Library Management System, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **shadcn/ui**.

It provides a modern, responsive interface for managing:

-  Books (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-  Members (Users with role-based access)
-  Issued Books (Issue, Return, View History)
-  Auth (Login, Logout)

The frontend is fully integrated with the FastAPI backend using REST APIs and offers a smooth admin experience with dialogs, filters, search, and table views.
